# Creating NFTs on ICP

A **non-fungible token**, commonly referred to as an NFT, is a type of tokenized asset that is assigned a unique identifier that is used to distinguish one NFT for another. An NFT cannot be replicated or reproduced since they are cryptographically unique. A non-fungible token is a type of token that cannot be exchanged 1:1 with another token of the same type, as the value of the NFT token can vary. In comparison, a **fungible** token can always be transferred 1:1 for another token of the same type.

For example, 1 USD can always be exchanged for 1 USD. However, 1 unique painting cannot be exchanged for another unique painting, since the value of the two paintings will be different.

On the Internet Computer, ICP is a fungible token that can always be exchanged for ICP of equal value. However, an NFT token deployed on ICP cannot be traded 1:1 with another NFT token deployed on ICP.

NFTs have enabled a wide range of different use-cases, since the ownership of an NFT can be verified via the blockchain and cannot be spoofed or faked. Just a few use-cases for NFTs include:

- Providing a way to buy, sell, or trade unique artwork or collectibles.

- Providing a way to buy digital assets, such as domain names or virtual worlds.

- Providing exclusive membership to gated content for users who purchase an NFT from a specific collection.

- Providing proof of ownership for real-world tangible assets, such as property.

- Providing proof of documents, such as an identification card or driver's license.

- Providing a way for content creators to monetize the content they create by minting it as an NFT.

## How do NFTs work?

Similar to fungible tokens, NFTs are created through a process known as minting. Minting is when a token is created on the blockchain by recording the token's data to the chain. When an NFT is minted on ICP, a canister smart contract is used to define the NFT's ownership, data and metadata, and provide the ability for the NFT to be transferred or sold to another user.

When an NFT is created, it is assigned a unique identifier that is used to distinguish the token from all other NFTs. Each token's data is public, including the ownership information, metadata information, and transaction history.

Some NFTs are '1 of 1' tokens, meaning they are globally unique and not part of a series or collection of NFTs. Other times, NFT tokens are '1 of 100' or '1 of 500', meaning they are part of a larger series that several people can purchase and retain the same benefits. '1 of 1' NFTs are often used in cases of unique art or identifying documents, while '1 of 100' NFTs are often used for providing membership to exclusive content or providing tickets to an event.

Even if 5_000 NFTs of the same exact item are minted, each token will have a unique identifier to define it among the others in the series. In some cases, each NFT in the collection will have a unique image to identify it visually; other times, each NFT will be exactly the same except for the unique token ID.

## NFT standards

Similar to token standards, such as the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 fungible token standards, NFTs are required to use a standard that sets the guidelines for API methods that support necessary NFT functionalities. Some common API methods for NFTs are the ability to mint an NFT, transfer the NFT, and query the NFT's metadata.

Currently on ICP, there are two NFT standards: DIP721 and ICRC-7.

### DIP721

The DIP721 NFT standard is designed as an Internet Computer adaptation of the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard. It is designed to provide a simple, non-ambiguous API for transferring and tracking the ownership of NFTs deployed on ICP.

DIP721 was designed to improve the existing ICP token standards by implementing the following:

- Providing proper metadata support for an NFT.

- Incurring a lesser cycles cost than multi-token standards.

- Providing the ability to track the history of NFT transfers.

- Providing an API that closely follows the original EIP-721 standard, making the ability to import existing Ethereum contracts onto ICP more straightforward.

### ICRC-7

ICRC-7 is a new standard for non-fungible tokens on ICP. Recall that "ICRC" stands for "Internet Computer Request for Comments", and is the standard created by the Internet Computer working group. An ICRC standard can be used for creating anything on ICP, not just fungible tokens such as the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 token standards.

The ICRC-7 standard is designed to be a minimal standard for allowing an NFT collection to be deployed on ICP. In an NFT collection, each NFT may have unique metadata information. This metadata may include a unique image, traits or tags, or a description describing the NFT.

The ICRC-7 standard implements several additional API methods compared to the DIP721 standard, such as batch query methods, batch update methods, and collection approval methods.

## Creating and deploying an NFT

In this tutorial, you'll create an NFT collection that will allow for multiples of the same NFT to be minted, but each will have the same benefits and attributes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [3. Developer environment setup](/docs/developer-journey/level-0/3-dev-env.mdx).

### Cloning the `azle-dip721-nft-standard` example

To get started, open a new terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_journey`), then use the following commands to clone the example repo and navigate into the `azle-dip721-nft-standard` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonath-z/azle-dip721-nft-standard
cd examples/motoko/azle-dip721-nft-standard
```

### Confirm your local identity

Verify that you are using the local identity that you'd like to be for deploying and minting your NFTs. This example will showcase using the `DevJourney` identity:

```bash
dfx identity use DevJourney
```

### Reviewing the project's files

```bash
├── README.md
├── dfx.json
└── src
    └── backend
        ├── index.ts
        └── index.did
.
.
.
```

This project uses a single-canister architecture as there is only one backend canister defined in the `dfx.json` file. This canister, called `backend`, uses the source code found in the file `src/backend/index.ts`:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "backend": {
      "type": "custom",
      "main": "src/backend/index.ts",
      "candid": "src/backend/index.did",
      "build": "npx azle backend",
      "wasm": ".azle/backend/backend.wasm",
      "gzip": true,
      "assets": [["src/frontend/dist", "dist"]],
      "build_assets": "npm run build",
      "metadata": [
        {
          "name": "candid:service",
          "path": "src/backend/index.did"
        },
        {
          "name": "cdk:name",
          "content": "azle"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This project provides a frontend which is not going to be used in this tutorial, meaning the project can only be interacted with by making calls to the backend canister via the CLI or through the Candid UI interface in a local web browser.

Next, open and review the canister's source code file at `src/backend/index.ts`. The code has been annotated with comments to explain the code's logic:

```

### Starting a local replica

Before you can deploy the project's canisters, you'll need to assure that a local replica is running with the command:

```bash
dfx start --clean
```

### Deploying the project's canister

Now that you've reviewed the canister's source code, you can now move onto creating your NFT token. To create your NFT, you will need an image file that will be used as the NFT's logo. Save this image file in the project's directory as the name `NFT_logo.png`.

![NFT collection logo](../_attachments/NFT_Logo.png)

Then, you can deploy the canister with the following initialization arguments:

```bash
dfx deploy backend --argument "(
  principal\"$(dfx identity get-principal)\",
  record {
    logo = record {
      logo_type = \"NFT_logo/png\";
      data = \"\";
    };
    name = \"Dev Journey NFT\";
    symbol = \"DJNFT\";
  }
)"
```

#### What this command does

- `principal`: Refers to the initial **custodian** of the NFT. A custodian is a user who has the permissions to administrate the NFT.

- `"$(dfx identity get-principal)"`: This string automatically interpolates the current identity used by `dfx` when this command was executed. In this tutorial, that identity will be the `DevJourney` identity.

- `logo`: Refers to the image file that represents the NFT.

- `name`: Refers to the string of text used as the name of the NFT.

- `symbol`: Refers to a short, unique string of characters used to identity the NFT tokens. A short, unique symbol to identify the token.

After running this command, you will receive output that resembles the following:

You will receive output that resembles the following:

```bash
URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai&id=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai
```

### Minting an NFT

Now that your canister is deployed, you can interact with it to mint your first NFT. Use the following command to call the canister's method `mint`:

```bash
dfx canister call backend mint \
"(
  principal\"$(dfx identity get-principal)\",
  vec {
    record {
      data = blob\"Developer Journey NFT\";
      key_val_data = vec {
        record { key = \"description\"; val = variant{TextContent=\"The NFT metadata can hold arbitrary metadata\"}; };
        record { key = \"tag\"; val = variant{TextContent=\"education\"}; };
        record { key = \"contentType\"; val = variant{TextContent=\"text/plain\"}; };
        record { key = \"locationType\"; val = variant{Nat8Content=4:nat8} };
      }
    }
  }
)"
```

#### What this command does

This command makes a call to the canister's `mint` method and passes the following parameters to the method:

- `description`: An string of text that describes the NFT's arbitrary metadata.

- `tag`: A string of text used to tag the NFT. Tags are typically used by search engines to help index search results.

- `contentType`: Refers to the type of content being minted into the NFT; in this example, the string 'Developer Journey NFT' is being passed to the method to be minted, so the `contentType` of `text/plain` is set.

- `locationType`: Refers to a `nat8` numerical value that is used to describe the NFT's location.

If successful, this command will return output that resembles the following:

```
(variant { Ok = record { id = 1 : nat; token_id = 0 : nat64 } })
```

### Transferring an NFT

The DIP721 standard supports transferring an NFT to another principal value through the use of the `transferFromDip721` and `safeTransferFromDip721` methods, in this tutorial it is `safeTransferFrom` method.

To transfer an NFT to another identity, first you will need a second identity which will become the identity that receives the transferred NFT. Create another identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity new NftTransfer
```

Then, create an environment variable that will store this new identity's principal value:

```bash
NFT_TRANSFER=$(dfx --identity NftTransfer identity get-principal)
```

You can verify that this environment variable was set correctly by printing its value with the `echo` command:

```bash
echo $NFT_TRANSFER
```

This should return the NftTransfer identity's principal.

Now, to transfer the NFT from your `DevJourney` identity to the `NftTransfer` identity, use the following command that calls the `backend` canister's method `safeTransferFrom`:

```bash
dfx canister call backend safeTransferFrom "(principal\"$(dfx identity get-principal)\", principal\"$NFT_TRANSFER\", 0)"
```

In this command, the `safeTransferFrom` method is used to transfer the NFT with token ID of `0` from the current user's principal (defined by `"$(dfx identity get-principal)\"`), to the principal stored in the environment variable `NFT_TRANSFER`.

If successful, this command will return output that resembles the following:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 2 : nat })
```

To transfer the NFT back to the original user identity, you can use the same command but with the opposite order of principals:

```bash
dfx canister call backend safeTransferFrom "(principal\"$NFT_TRANSFER\", principal\"$(dfx identity get-principal)\", 0)"
```

This second transfer works since the identity making the call, your `DevJourney` identity. This command will return output that resembles the following:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 3 : nat })
```

### Querying the balance of NFTs for your user principal

To query the balance of NFTs that your user principal owns, you can make a call to the canister's `balanceOf` method with the command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend balanceOf "(principal\"$(dfx identity get-principal)\")"
```

For this tutorial, the output of this command should return a balance of `1`:

```bash
(1 : nat64)
```

### Querying the maximum amount of minted NFTs

To query the maximum amount of minted NFTs, you can make a call to the canister's `totalSupply` method with the command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend totalSupply
```

In this tutorial, the output of this command should return the number of minted NFTs recorded.

### Querying the NFT's metadata

To query the NFT's metadata information, first you will need the token's ID. This was returned in the output of the command used when you minted the NFT with the `mint` method:

```bash
(variant { Ok = record { id = 1 : nat; token_id = 0 : nat64 } })
```

In this example, the token ID is `0`. Then, use this token ID in the following command to call the canister's `getMetadata` method:

```bash
dfx canister call backend getMetadata "0"
```

This command will return the metadata for the NFT with token ID `0`:

```bash
(
  variant {
    Ok = vec {
      record {
        data = blob "Developer Journey NFT";
        key_val_data = vec {
          record {
            key = "description";
            val = variant {
              TextContent = "The NFT metadata can hold arbitrary metadata"
            };
          };
          record { key = "tag"; val = variant { TextContent = "education" } };
          record {
            key = "contentType";
            val = variant { TextContent = "text/plain" };
          };
          record {
            key = "locationType";
            val = variant { Nat8Content = 4 : nat8 };
          };
        };
      };
    }
  },
)
```

### Querying the NFT's information

To query the NFT's logo image, you can make a call to the canister's `logo` method using the command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend logo
```

This command will return the NFT logo's image file:

```bash
(record { data = ""; logo_type = "NFT_logo/png" })
```

To query the NFT's name, you can make a call to the `name` method using the command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend name
```

This will return the NFT's name that was set when you created the NFT canister:

```bash
("Dev Journey NFT")
```

To query the NFT's symbol, you can make a call to the `symbol` method using the command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend symbol
```

This will return the NFT's symbol:

```
("DJNFT")
```

### Querying the owner of a specific token ID

To get the principal ID that owns a specific NFT token ID, you can query the `ownerOf` method with the token ID by running the following command:

```bash
dfx canister call backend ownerOf "0"
```

This will return your user principal:

```bash
(
  variant {
    Ok = principal "5wuse-ejxao-gkqq6-4dhl5-hn5ps-2mgop-2se4s-w4zle-agr6j-svlhq-3qe"
  },
)
```

You can verify that this is the same principal that you used to mint the NFT by querying principal ID of the local developer identity currently used:

```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```
