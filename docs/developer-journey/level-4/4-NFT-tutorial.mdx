# 4. Creating NFTs on ICP


A **non-fungible token**, commonly referred to as an NFT, is a type of tokenized asset that is assigned a unique identifier that is used to distinguish one NFT for another. An NFT cannot be replicated or reproduced since they are cryptographically unique. A non-fungible token is a type of token that cannot be exchanged 1:1 with another token of the same type, as the value of the NFT token can vary. In comparison, a **fungible** token can always be transferred 1:1 for another token of the same type.

For example, 1 USD can always be exchanged for 1 USD. However, 1 unique painting cannot be exchanged for another unique painting, since the value of the two paintings will be different.

On the Internet Computer, ICP is a fungible token that can always be exchanged for ICP of equal value. However, an NFT token deployed on ICP cannot be traded 1:1 with another NFT token deployed on ICP.

NFTs have enabled a wide range of different use-cases, since the ownership of an NFT can be verified via the blockchain and cannot be spoofed or faked. Just a few use-cases for NFTs include:

- Providing a way to buy, sell, or trade unique artwork or collectibles.

- Providing a way to buy digital assets, such as domain names or virtual worlds.

- Providing exclusive membership to gated content for users who purchase an NFT from a specific collection.

- Providing proof of ownership for real-world tangible assets, such as property.

- Providing proof of documents, such as an identification card or driver's license.

- Providing a way for content creators to monetize the content they create by minting it as an NFT.

## How do NFTs work?

Similar to fungible tokens, NFTs are created through a process known as minting. Minting is when a token is created on the blockchain by recording the token's data to the chain. When an NFT is minted on ICP, a canister smart contract is used to define the NFT's ownership, data and metadata, and provide the ability for the NFT to be transferred or sold to another user.

When an NFT is created, it is assigned a unique identifier that is used to distinguish the token from all other NFTs. Each token's data is public, including the ownership information, metadata information, and transaction history.

Some NFTs are '1 of 1' tokens, meaning they are globally unique and not part of a series or collection of NFTs. Other times, NFT tokens are '1 of 100' or '1 of 500', meaning they are part of a larger series that several people can purchase and retain the same benefits. '1 of 1' NFTs are often used in cases of unique art or identifying documents, while '1 of 100' NFTs are often used for providing membership to exclusive content or providing tickets to an event.

Even if 5_000 NFTs of the same exact item are minted, each token will have a unique identifier to define it among the others in the series. In some cases, each NFT in the collection will have a unique image to identify it visually; other times, each NFT will be exactly the same except for the unique token ID.

## NFT standards

Similar to token standards, such as the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 fungible token standards, NFTs are required to use a standard that sets the guidelines for API methods that support necessary NFT functionalities. Some common API methods for NFTs are the ability to mint an NFT, transfer the NFT, and query the NFT's metadata.

Currently on ICP, there are two NFT standards: DIP721 and ICRC-7.

### DIP721

The DIP721 NFT standard is designed as an Internet Computer adaptation of the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard. It is designed to provide a simple, non-ambiguous API for transferring and tracking the ownership of NFTs deployed on ICP.

DIP721 was designed to improve the existing ICP token standards by implementing the following:

- Providing proper metadata support for an NFT.

- Incurring a lesser cycles cost than multi-token standards.

- Providing the ability to track the history of NFT transfers.

- Providing an API that closely follows the original EIP-721 standard, making the ability to import existing Ethereum contracts onto ICP more straightforward.


### ICRC-7

ICRC-7 is a new standard for non-fungible tokens on ICP. Recall that "ICRC" stands for "Internet Computer Request for Comments", and is the standard created by the Internet Computer working group. An ICRC standard can be used for creating anything on ICP, not just fungible tokens such as the ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 token standards.

The ICRC-7 standard is designed to be a minimal standard for allowing an NFT collection to be deployed on ICP. In an NFT collection, each NFT may have unique metadata information. This metadata may include a unique image, traits or tags, or a description describing the NFT.

The ICRC-7 standard implements several additional API methods compared to the DIP721 standard, such as batch query methods, batch update methods, and collection approval methods.

## Creating and deploying an NFT

In this tutorial, you'll create an NFT collection that will allow for multiples of the same NFT to be minted. This example will set a maximum supply of 50 NFT tokens, meaning 50 NFTs with unique identifiers will be minted, but each will have the same benefits and attributes.
