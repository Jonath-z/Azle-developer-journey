# Creating a decentralized token swap

The Internet Computer enables decentralized finance (DeFi) applications through its design that includes complex, on-chain computation. One primary example of a DeFi application is a decentralized exchange (DEX). A DEX is an exchange that can be used to buy, sell, trade, and withdraw cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without a centralized authority that authorizes the trades, such as bank. Decentralized exchanges are extremely useful, as they allow users to buy and hold cryptocurrencies, trade it directly for another token or coin, then withdraw the tokens to be used elsewhere.

## Decentralized token swap canister

In this tutorial, you'll deploy a simple token swap canister that demonstrates the core functionalities that a DEX provides:

- Deposit tokens: Deposit tokens into the canister to be swapped for another token.

- Swap tokens: Swap tokens for other tokens, using a simple 1:1 swap ratio to demonstrate basic functionality.

- Withdraw tokens: After tokens have been swapped, they can be withdrawn from the canister.

Once a user has deposited funds, the tokens deposited can be swapped from one token to another. A trading pair is a set of two assets that can be traded with each other on an exchange. A token swap consists of two tuple values that represent the trading pair, such as [Token1, amount1] and [Token2, amount2].

In this example, the token swap canister simply swaps all deposits for two users. `user_a`'s entire token balance of `token_a` is given to `user_b`, and `user_b`'s entire token balance of `token_b` is given to `user_a`.

This example will use ICRC-2 tokens. To learn more about ICRC tokens, refer to the previous module [2. ICRC tokens](/docs/developer-journey/level-3/2-icrc-tokens.mdx)

### Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [3. Developer environment setup](/docs/developer-journey/level-0/3-dev-env.mdx).

### Cloning the `icrc2-swap` example

To get started, open a new terminal window, navigate into your working directory (`developer_journey`), then use the following commands to clone the example repo and navigate into the `icp-token-swap-canister` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonath-z/icp-token-swap-canister
cd icp-token-swap-canister
```

### Reviewing the project's files

First, let's review the files that are in this project:

```bash
.
.
.
├── dfx.json
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── backend
│       └── index.ts
        └── index.did
        └── token_a.did
        └── token_b.did
├── test
│   ├── pretest.ts
│   ├── test.ts
│   ├── tests.ts
│
└── tsconfig.json
```

In this project, there are 3 did files in the `src/backend` subdirectory:

- `index.did`: The backend candid interface

- `token_a.did` and `token_b.did`: Define `ICRC-2` token candid interfaces

Then, open the project's `dfx.json` file to review the project's canisters and configuration:

```json

  "canisters": {
    "backend": {
      "type": "custom",
      "main": "src/backend/index.ts",

      }
    },

      ".env": [
        "AZLE_TEST_FETCH",
        "CANISTER_ID_TOKEN_B",
        "CANISTER_ID_TOKEN_A",
        "CANISTER_ID_BACKEND"
      ]
    },
    "token_b": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "src/backend/token_b.did",
      "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/2e3589427cd9648d4edaebc1b96b5daf8fdd94d8/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
      ".env": [
        "AZLE_TEST_FETCH",
        "CANISTER_ID_TOKEN_B",
        "CANISTER_ID_TOKEN_A",
        "CANISTER_ID_BACKEND"
      ]
    }
  },
  "output_env_file": ".env"
}
```

In this project's configuration, you can see definition of three canisters:

- The `backend` canister: This canister provides the deposit, swap, and withdraw functionality for the project's ICRC-2 tokens. It uses the source code found at `src/backend/index.ts`.

- The `token_a` canister: This canister is used to create `token_a`, an ICRC-2 token. This canister uses the most recent ICRC ledger Wasm and Candid files. To learn more about the ICRC Wasm and Candid files, refer to the previous module [2. ICRC tokens](/docs/developer-journey/level-3/2-icrc-tokens.mdx)

- The `token_b` canister: The canister is used to create `token_b`, an ICRC-2 token. This canister uses the most recent ICRC ledger Wasm and Candid files. To learn more about the ICRC Wasm and Candid files, refer to the previous module [2. ICRC tokens](/docs/developer-journey/level-3/2-icrc-tokens.mdx)

Next, open the `src/backend/index.ts` file and review its contents. This code has been annotated with notes to explain the program's functionality:

```TypeScript

      return {
        [value]: balanceB.get(value).Some,
      };
    });

    return JSON.stringify({ balancesA, balancesB });
  }),

  deposit: update([DepositArgs], TransferFromResult, async (transferArgs) => {
    console.log({ env: process.env });
    const tokenId = transferArgs.token.toString();
    console.log({

    const transferData: TransferArgs = {

      return "Success";
    }
  ),
});
```

### Starting a local replica

Before you can deploy the project's canister, you'll need to assure that a local replica is running with the command:

```bash
dfx start --clean
```

### Creating identities for `user_a` and `user_b`:

Create new local identities for `user_a` and `user_b` that will be used for the token swap:

```bash
dfx identity new user_a
dfx identity new user_b
```

Then, save the principals for these identities as environmental variables to reference later:

```bash
export USER_A=$(dfx identity get-principal --identity user_a)
export USER_B=$(dfx identity get-principal --identity user_b)
```

Next, switch to your DevJourney identity and save its principal as the environmental variable `OWNER`:

```bash
dfx identity use DevJourney
export OWNER=$(dfx identity get-principal)
```

### Deploying token_a

Next, deploy `token_a` by deploying the `token_a` canister and passing a series of arguments to the canister to create the token:

```bash
dfx deploy token_a --argument '
  (variant {
    Init = record {
      token_name = "Token A";
      token_symbol = "A";
      minting_account = record {
        owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      initial_balances = vec {
        record {
          record {
            owner = principal "'${USER_A}'";
          };
          100_000_000_000;
        };
      };
      metadata = vec {};
      transfer_fee = 10_000;
      archive_options = record {
        trigger_threshold = 2000;
        num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
        controller_id = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      feature_flags = opt record {
        icrc2 = true;
      };
    }
  })
'
```

In this command, `token_a` is created with the following configuration:

- `token_name`: Defines the token's name as 'Token A'.
- `token_symbol`: Defines the token's symbol as 'A'.
- `minting_account`: Defines the minting account as the `OWNER` environmental variable. This variable holds the principal of your DevJourney identity.
- `initial_balances`: Defines the initial balance of tokens as '100_000_000_000'.
  - `owner`: Defines the owner of the initial token balance (100_000_000_000) as the `USER_A` environmental variable. This variable holds the principal of the user_a identity.
- `transfer_fee`: Defines the transfer fee as '10_000'.
- `trigger_threshold`: Defines the trigger threshold as '2000'.
- `num_blocks_to_archive`: Defines the number of blocks to archive as '1000'.
- `controller_id`: Define's the controller ID as the `OWNER` environmental variable.
- `feature_flags`: Defines a feature flag.
  - `icrc2`: Set as 'true' to define the token using the ICRC-2 standard.

### Deploying token_b

Next, deploy `token_b` by deploying the `token_b` canister and passing a series of arguments to the canister to create the token:

```bash
dfx deploy token_b --argument '
  (variant {
    Init = record {
      token_name = "Token B";
      token_symbol = "B";
      minting_account = record {
        owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      initial_balances = vec {
        record {
          record {
            owner = principal "'${USER_B}'";
          };
          100_000_000_000;
        };
      };
      metadata = vec {};
      transfer_fee = 10_000;
      archive_options = record {
        trigger_threshold = 2000;
        num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
        controller_id = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      feature_flags = opt record {
        icrc2 = true;
      };
    }
  })
'
```

In this command, `token_b` is created with the following configuration:

- `token_name`: Defines the token's name as 'Token B'.
- `token_symbol`: Defines the token's symbol as 'B'.
- `minting_account`: Defines the minting account as the `OWNER` environmental variable. This variable holds the principal of your DevJourney identity.
- `initial_balances`: Defines the initial balance of tokens as '100_000_000_000'.
  - `owner`: Defines the owner of the initial token balance (100_000_000_000) as the `USER_B` environmental variable. This variable holds the principal of the user_a identity.
- `transfer_fee`: Defines the transfer fee as '10_000'.
- `trigger_threshold`: Defines the trigger threshold as '2000'.
- `num_blocks_to_archive`: Defines the number of blocks to archive as '1000'.
- `controller_id`: Define's the controller ID as the `OWNER` environmental variable.
- `feature_flags`: Defines a feature flag.
  - `icrc2`: Set as 'true' to define the token using the ICRC-2 standard.

### Exporting the token canister IDs as environmental variables

Next, export the token canister IDs as environmental variables:

```bash
export TOKEN_A=$(dfx canister id token_a)
export TOKEN_B=$(dfx canister id token_b)
```

### Deploying the swap canister

Then its time to deploy the swap canister. Use the following command, which passes the canister IDs for the token canisters as arguments to the swap canister:

```bash
dfx deploy backend

dfx canister call backend initialize '
  record {
    token_a = (principal "'${TOKEN_A}'");
    token_b = (principal "'${TOKEN_B}'");
  }
'
```

Then, export the canister ID of the swap canister as an environmental variable:

```bash
export SWAP=$(dfx canister id backend)
```

### Depositing tokens into the swap canister

Before tokens can be swapped, they must be transferred into the swap canister. Since the tokens in this example uses ICRC-2 tokens, this is a two-step process. First, the transfer must be approved. In this example, approve `user_a` to deposit 1.00000000 of `token_a`, and include 0.0001 extra for the transfer fee:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_a token_a icrc2_approve '
  record {
    amount = 100_010_000;
    spender = record {
      owner = principal "'${SWAP}'";
    };
  }
'
```

This command should return the following output:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 1 : nat })
```

Then, approve `user_b` to deposit 1.00000000 of `token_b`, and include 0.0001 extra for the transfer fee:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_b token_b icrc2_approve '
  record {
    amount = 100_010_000;
    spender = record {
      owner = principal "'${SWAP}'";
    };
  }
'
```

This command should return the following output:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 1 : nat })
```

Now, you can call the backend canister's deposit method. This method performs the actual token transfer, moving the tokens from the user's wallets into the swap canister. First, deposit `user_a`'s tokens:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_a backend deposit 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_A}'";
  from = record {
    owner = principal "'${USER_A}'";
  };
  amount = 100_000_000;
}'
```

Then, deposit `user_b`'s tokens:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_b backend deposit 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_B}'";
  from = record {
    owner = principal "'${USER_B}'";
  };
  amount = 100_000_000;
}'
```

### Performing a token swap

Now that both users have deposited their tokens into the swap canister, a token swap can be performed by calling the swap canister's `swap` method:

```bash
dfx canister call backend swap 'record {
  user_a = principal "'${USER_A}'";
  user_b = principal "'${USER_B}'";
}'
```

Then, check the balances for each user to confirm that `user_b` holds `token_a`, and `user_a` holds `token_b`:

```bash
dfx canister call backend balances
```

The output of this command will resemble the following:

```json
{
  "balancesA": [
    {
      "kmp6t-h6ejb-tekcb-i3fcl-ftmq5-vy7xh-aqgeo-vmj7q-eyelp-3qrzy-cqe": 100000000
    }
  ],
  "balancesB": [
    {
      "wf2zm-xaady-dvxcj-oqfh5-7pman-ijt2j-x2ikl-hzdvy-jf5qe-e4qda-fae": 100000000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Withdrawing tokens

Now that the swap has been completed, the users can withdraw their newly received tokens out of the backend canister. First, withdraw `user_a`'s balance of 1.00000000 `token_b` tokens, minus the 0.0001 transfer fee:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_a backend withdraw 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_B}'";
  to = record {
    owner = principal "'${USER_A}'";
  };
  amount = 99_990_000;
}'
```

Then, withdraw `user_b`'s balance of 1.00000000 `token_a` tokens, minus the 0.0001 transfer fee:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity user_b backend withdraw 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_A}'";
  to = record {
    owner = principal "'${USER_B}'";
  };
  amount = 99_990_000;
}'
```

### Checking token balances

To confirm everything worked as expected, check the token balance for each user. First, check `user_a`'s balance of `token_a`. This user should have 998.99980000 A:

```bash
dfx canister call token_a icrc1_balance_of 'record {
  owner = principal "'${USER_A}'";
}'
```

Then, check `user_b`'s balance of `token_b`. This user should have 998.99980000 B:

```bash
dfx canister call token_b icrc1_balance_of 'record {
  owner = principal "'${USER_B}'";
}'
```
