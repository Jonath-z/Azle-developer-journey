# 3. Introduction to agents

When you have a canister running, either locally or on the mainnet, you have two primary ways for interacting with the canister: using the API through an agent, or using the canister's HTTP interface. On the Internet Computer, an **agent** is a library used to make calls to ICP's public interface.

## What does an agent do?

### Structuring data

One of the first responsibilities of an agent is to structure data. As was discussed in previous modules, such as [2. Advanced canister calls](/docs/developer-journey/level-1/2-advanced-canister-calls.mdx), calls to ICP can be an update or a query call. An agent submits a `POST` request to the canister's API at the URL `/api/v2/canister/<effective_canister_id>/call`. This post request contains the following components:

- `request_type`.
- Authentication, comprised of the `sender`, `nonce`, and `ingress_expiry`.
- `canister_id`.
- `method_name`.
- `request_id`, which is required for update calls. The `request_id` value is the result of hashing the other fields in the request, and is used for polling while ICP reaches consensus on the update call. **Polling** is a technique used to check for fresh data over a given interval of time by making repeated API requests to a server.
- `arg`, which contains the rest of the call's payload. The agent assembles the `arg` portion of the call with data from the client application, ensuring that the Candid interface matches the method that it calls.

Each of these components are assembled into a certificate, which is then transformed into a [CBOR-encoded](https://cbor.io/) buffer. The agent takes this CBOR-encoded certificate and attaches it to the body of the `POST` request. When the canister begins to process the request asynchronously, the agent begins polling the `read_status` requests until the canister returns a response.

The agent takes the CBOR-encoded certificate and attaches it to the body of the POST request. The canister will work on that request asynchronously, and then the agent can begin polling with read_state requests, until the canister response is ready.

### Decoding data

Once a response has been returned from the mainnet, the agent takes the certificate from the call's payload and verifies it. This certificate can be verified using the public root key of ICP's NNS subnet. The network will return a CBOR-encoded buffer for the agent to decode, then transform into a useful structure using semantic language-specific types. For example, if the canister returns a type `Text`, and the agent is a JavaScript agent, the text will get turned into a JavaScript string.

### Managing authentication

Each call to the Internet Computer mainnet needs to have a cryptographic identity attached to the call. This identity can be anonymous or authenticated using a cryptographic signature. Canisters use a call's attached identity to determine how to respond to the call, which enables smart contracts to use identities for other purposes as well.

#### Accepted identities

The following types of signatures in identities can be attached to calls to ICP:

- [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) and [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) signatures.
  - Plain signatures are supported for the schemes.
- [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) or [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) on curve P-256 (also known as [secp256r1](https://neuromancer.sk/std/secg/secp256r1)).
  - Using SHA-256 as a hash function.
  - Using the Koblitz curve in [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1).

When an agent encodes these identities as a principal, they attach a suffix byte which indicates whether the identity is anonymous or self-authenticating. An anonymous identity will use a suffix byte of `4`, which resolves to `2vxsx-fae`, while self-authenticating identities that uses one of the curves above uses a suffix of `2`.

## Available agents

Currently, there are two agents developed by DFINITY: the JavaScript/TypeScript agent, and the Rust agent.
